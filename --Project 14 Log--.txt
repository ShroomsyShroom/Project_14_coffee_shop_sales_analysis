--SQL Queries--

For SQL based analysis,
1. Open PgAdmin or your preffered SQL application
2. Create a new database titled Coffee Shop DB or whatever name you may wanna give it.
3. In this New database create a new table using the following query:

Code:

CREATE TABLE coffee_shop (
	transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	transaction_date DATE,
	transaction_time TIME,
	transaction_qty INT,
	store_id INT,
	store_location VARCHAR(50),
	product_id INT,
	unit_price FLOAT,
	product_category VARCHAR(50),
	product_type VARCHAR(50),
	product_detail VARCHAR(50)
	)

4. Now, with the table created, import the data in it from your dataset.
5. Now that we've created the table and imported the data in it, lets see the table using the following query:

Code:

SELECT * FROM coffee_shop;

6. Now that we've done everything needed, lets move onto some analysis:

A. Total Sales Analysis:

a. Total sales for each month

7. Now that we've analysed the data using SQL, we'll make a visualisation using Power BI in form of a dashboard.
